# Disclaimer (Before you begin capturing) #

This is our modification of an now outdated version of renderdoc. renderdoc evolves, but we do not integrate these changes into our version.

* We added functions that are not available in plain renderdoc. Running our scripts against a version from the regular renderdoc repository will not work.
* Bugs you find in our version should not be reported to the official renderdoc repository as they may have been fixed already. (except they also occur in the regular renderdoc version independent of using our code).
* Do not ask for help in capturing commercial games on the renderdoc forums.
* If you need features from more recent renderdoc releases, you will need to modify renderdoc on your own.

API Support
--------------

|                  | Status                                 | Windows                  | Linux                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| D3D11            | Well supported, all features.          | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| OpenGL 3.2 core+ | Well supported, most features.\*       | :heavy_check_mark:       | :heavy_check_mark: No UI\*\*    |
| OpenGL Pre-3.2   | No immediate plans                     | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| D3D10            | No immediate plans                     | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| D3D9             | No immediate plans                     | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| Mantle           | Plans cancelled, redirected to Vulkan. | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| D3D12            | Planned for the future.                | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |
| Vulkan           | Planned for the future.                | :heavy_multiplication_x: | :heavy_multiplication_x:        |

* D3D11 has full feature support and is stable & tested. Feature Level 11 hardware is assumed - Radeon 4000/5000+, GeForce 400+, Intel Ivy Bridge, falling back to WARP software emulation if this hardware isn't present.
* \*OpenGL is only explicitly supported for the core profile 3.2+ subset of features, check the [OpenGL wiki page](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/wiki/OpenGL) for details.
* \*\*A Qt version of the UI is planned, with some [implementation notes on the wiki](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc/wiki/QRenderDoc-Notes).

Downloads
--------------

There are [binary releases](https://renderdoc.org/builds) available, built from the release targets. If you just want to use the program and you ended up here, this is what you want :).

It's recommended that if you're new you start with the stable builds. Beta builds are available for those who want more regular updates with the latest features and fixes, but might run into some bugs as well. Nightly builds are available every day from master branch here if you need it.

Documentation
--------------

As mentioned above there are some [youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/baldurkarlsson/) showing the use of some basic features and an introduction/overview.

There is also a great presentation by [@Icetigris](https://twitter.com/Icetigris) which goes into some details of how RenderDoc can be used in real world situations: [slides are up here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LQUMIld4SGoQVthnhT1scoA3k4Sg0as14G4NeSiSgFU/edit#slide=id.p).

License
--------------

RenderDoc is released under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for full text as well as 3rd party library acknowledgements.

Building
--------------

Building RenderDoc is fairly straight forward. See [COMPILE.md](COMPILE.md) for more details.

Contributing & Development
--------------

I've added some notes on how to contribute, as well as where to get started looking through the code in [COMPILE.md](COMPILE.md) - check there for more details on how to set up to build renderdoc and where to start contributing to its development.
